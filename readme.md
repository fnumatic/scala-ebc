### eventbased components for scala

This is a library to discover the possibilities of "Flow Based Design". The main purpose is to provide small building blocks: FunctionUnit and Board and a lightweight dsl to show the flow between them.

### outstanding issues

 - asynchronous flow
 - problem with stackoverflow on recursive flows

### plans

 - implementation with pure actors
 - implementation with scala.react @ github.com/ingoem/scala-react
  
 Currently fighting with it.

 **I hope, that Ingo Maier show us some simple and working examples soon!!!**

### credits

 - Ralf Westphal - main inspiration "Flow Based Design"
 - Naftoli Gugenheim @ github.com/nafg/reactive - to my knowledge, he delivered the first **working** framework for reactive programming in scala. My library is essentially based on his framework.
